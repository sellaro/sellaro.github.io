title: The conscientious information consumer 
categories: [Knowledge Management]

I have been introduced to the Zettelkasten method recently. 
It’s amazing how I was utterly unaware for so long of a thing which is so dear to my interests. 
I am astonished by my ignorance about the method and by its beauty.

All my old attempts to use Evernote to link notes, tag them, and all that jazz. 
All failed attempts to do exactly what Zettelkasten does. Getting to know Zettelkasten made me realize how off track I have been so far. 
I noticed that I was living the “collector’s fallacy”. A fancy term to describe the drive I have to collect information and feel good about it. 
Not perceiving, of course, an important detail: One needs to also put some effort to process and understand what is collected.
Knowing about things is not the same as knowing things. In other words, collecting for collecting sake means accumulating clutter. Christian Tietze, one of the authors behind [http://zettelkasten.de](http://zettelkasten.de/), says it better [here](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/):

>There’s a tendency in all of us to gather useful stuff and feel good about it. To collect is a reward in itself. As knowledge workers, we’re inclined to look for the next groundbreaking thought, for intellectual stimulation: we pile up promising books and articles, and we store half the internet as bookmarks, just so we get the feeling of being on the cutting edge.

One thing – understanding how trapped I was – lead to another, and here I am writing again. The intention is to rekindle the creator in me. I am pledging to be mindful about the information I consume. To process and understand it, as opposed to collecting it. This commitment means I recognize the need to invest time to work on the themes I have an interest in. As I read, I must take notes. Mix the new concepts with my thoughts. Organize the resulting ideas, and store them in my Zettelkasten system. That’s how I can set myself free from accumulating information for the sake of intellectual feel-goodness. The point is to connect thoughts, creating new bridges and — in the end of the day — knowledge.

I expect to reflect about the world I am part of. To be marginally closer to the philosophical truth. Even to expose part of this reflection to the world with the hope to be contributing to something good. Other pieces of my writing, of course, will be private and live only in my journal.

The bottom line: The writer I am is back.

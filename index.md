This is a minimalist approach to a website. It’s clean. It’s uncluttered. It’s straight to the point.

Since I deleted all my social network accounts, I felt the need to (re)build a simple website. An online place where anybody can see what I am [focusing on now](now). Where I can write about what I’ve been reading, the world and the things as I see them.

> Writing is a powerful search mechanism, and one of its satisfactions is to come to terms with our life narrative. Another is to work through some of life’s hardest knocks – loss, grief, illness, addiction, disappointment, failure – and to find understanding and solace. - _William Zinsser_
